        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to integrate LLM tools from various frameworks—including [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/tools), [CrewAI Tools](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/main), and [PydanticAI Tools](https://ai.pydantic.dev/tools/) into the AG2 framework. This process enables smooth interoperability between these systems, allowing developers to leverage the unique capabilities of each toolset within AG2's flexible agent-based architecture. By the end of this guide, you will understand how to configure agents, adapt these tools for use in AG2, and validate the integration through practical examples."

        "LangChain is a popular framework that offers a wide range of tools to work with LLMs. LangChain has already implemented a variety of tools that can be easily integrated into AG2. You can explore the available tools in the [LangChain Community Tools](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/community/langchain_community/tools) folder. These tools, such as those for querying APIs, web scraping, and text generation, can be quickly incorporated into AG2, providing powerful functionality for your agents.\n",
